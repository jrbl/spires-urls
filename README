= Introduction =
You don't care about this; it's very special-purpose.

== I don't care at all? == 
Well, maybe you do.  If you want to learn about the SPIRES database command 
language, or how to extract http:// URLs from a pile of text files.  But you'd
probably be better served reading StackOverflow.  

== But really, what is it? ==
This is a loose collection of stuff intended to answer some of the following
questions:
* What non-traditional material (ie, other than papers) are HEP scientists
  publishing, and how has that changed over the last 20 years?
* How much of this material is no longer available?
* What is the rough rate of bitrot among physics materials?
* Of materials whose sites still respond to HTTP GET, approximately what's
  there?

= Manifest =
spi-gather-urlstats.cmd is a SPIRES command file.  To use it, you must log 
  into a SPIRES server on the command-line, and run SPIRES, by executing:
  $ spires
  Then run:
  > use spi-gather-urlstats.cmd
  > xeq
  If you do this in a screen session, then you can capture the output from 
  the batch execution and store it for later reference (e.g., 
  output/spi-gather-urlstats.out)
