spi-gather-urlstats.cmd is a SPIRES command file.  To use it, you must log 
  into a SPIRES server on the command-line, and run SPIRES, by executing:
  $ spires
  Then run:
  > use spi-gather-urlstats.cmd
  > xeq
  If you do this in a screen session, then you can capture the output from 
  the batch execution and store it for later reference (e.g., 
  output/spi-gather-urlstats.out)
